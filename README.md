# OneSearch
Type your search once, receive all the results you need!

Despite the current browsers settings to customize search results, they're lack of intuitiveness for common users and the difficult to set up at first. With this tool, you just need to install, open the settings and mark each wanted option: it's ready! You'll type your search, and all the results will be linked for you.

Installation through Chrome's Developer Mode.
